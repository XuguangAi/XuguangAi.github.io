Education
======
* M.S. in Data Science, University of Kentucky, 2023
* M.S. in Physics, University of Kentucky, 2021
* B.S. in Physics, Shandong University, 2014

Work experience
======
* August 2021 – Present: Research Assistant
  * Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky
  * Designed and implemented an end-to-end relation extraction model for extracting chemical-protein interactions from biomedical literature. Achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score, marking a >4% improvement over prior deep learning models on a benchmark biomedical dataset (ChemProt).
  * Designed an end-to-end relation extraction deep learning model for rare diseases from medical texts, with the ability to handle discontinuous entities. Additionally, conducted comparative experiments using generative models such as BioGPT against traditional BERT-like approaches.

* May 2022 – August 2022: Data Scientist Intern
  * Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, Mayo Clinic
  * Developed a robust algorithm for the de-identification of Protected Health Information, optimizing its suitability for machine learning applications.
  * Developed a span-based deep learning model to extract family history information (including diseases and conditions) from Mayo Clinic records, achieving a >3% improvement over prior methodologies.
 
* August 2016 – August 2021: Research Assistant
  * Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Kentucky
  * Developed theoretical physics models to analyze and predict the behavior of self-interacting dark matter, highlighting skills in data analysis and mathematical modeling.
