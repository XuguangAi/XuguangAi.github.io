<p>I have a deep passion for NLP & CV and applying AI in healthcare. I earned my MS degree in Data Science from University of Kentucky, where I also had the opportunity to work as a Research Assistant under the mentorship of [Dr. Ramakanth Kavuluru](https://www.engr.uky.edu/directory/kavuluru-ramakanth). I'm always open to connections and discussions so please don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
