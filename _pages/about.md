My name is Xuguang Ai. I have a deep passion for NLP & CV and applying AI in healthcare. I earned my MS degree in Data Science from University of Kentucky, where I also had the opportunity to work as a Research Assistant under the mentorship of [Prof. Ramakanth Kavuluru](https://www.engr.uky.edu/directory/kavuluru-ramakanth). Currently, I am a Data Scientist at the [Biomedical Informatics & Data Science](https://medicine.yale.edu/biomedical-informatics-data-science/) department at Yale University. I'm always open to connections and discussions so please don't hesitate to get in touch!
